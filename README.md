# Retro Games Recommendation

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

An AI recommender that recommends retro games titels for you to play based on the games you play today. Play the games that your favourite titel in this generation was inspired by.

## Background

This project helps you sift through the wast library of retro games and recommends titels that you might be interested in based on your favourite games of today. With retro games titels being added to digital libraries a vast amount of games are up for grabs for gamers today. But the problem that arises is how to choose from that giant volume of titels. With this recommendation AI gamers will get the help they need to pick a titel that will suit them. 

## How is it used?

By entering your favourite game titels into the database the AI will pull recommendations from the vast retro games library. It will tell you on wich platforms different games are available, price and reviews and also links to trailers etc. 

## Data sources and AI methods

Data comes from different libraries such as Nintendo Switch Online https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/online/nintendo-switch-online/

## Challenges

The recommendation app isn't a 'one solution'-app where all your games are stored. You need to have separate accounts at the different vendors. Vendors might also merge and/or move their digital libraries making the recommendation AI need for constant updates and work.


## What next?

Someone with knowledge, passion and funds to make this into reality. There's probably no kind of financial gain in an AI like this but it would more be a passion project.
